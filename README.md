# Concurrent System Modeling and Simulation

This project models and simulates a concurrent system involving two competing processes using formal modeling with FSP (Finite State Processes) and Java multithreading. The work includes verifying safety and progress properties, implementing shared resource access logic, and visualizing the protocol execution.

## 🚀 Overview

- Defined concurrent process models using **FSP**
- Verified **safety** and **progress** properties using the **LTSA** tool
- Implemented the specified protocol in **Java** using threads, monitors, and a text-based UI
- Mapped each part of the implementation directly to the formal specification
- Achieved a **Distinction** grade for this individual project (UK 70+ standard)

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java (Monitors, Threads, UI)
- FSP (Finite State Processes)
- LTSA (Labelled Transition System Analyser)
