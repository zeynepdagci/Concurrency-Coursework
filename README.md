Modeled and implemented safe concurrent system with FSP and Java simulation:

-Added FSP models for labelled transition system (LTS) behaviour of NS and WE processes and their parallel composition (Q1)

-Calculated probability and timing analysis for DRINKS machine (Q2)

-Modeled gang court access problem using FSP with safety properties and structural diagram (Q3)

-Extended model with handkerchief-based court-sharing protocol and verified safety (Q4)

-Introduced and verified progress properties for greedy and non-greedy gang behavior (Q5)

-Modeled and verified Officer Krupke's protocol using FSP with updated safety and progress checks (Q6)

-Implemented Java thread and monitor-based simulation of Officer Krupkeâ€™s solution with UI (Q7)

-Demonstrated correctness of LTS behavior using LTSA tools with provided FSP code (Q8)
